# WeatherDot

A quick and easy-to-use Android app that provides accurate weather forecasts from cities around the world.

## Description

WeatherDot is my first completed Android app after finishing Google's Android Developer Fundamentals course. I've applied all of the topics I've learned from the course as functions and features throughout the app. For example, you'll see the use of various Android Architecture Components like the Room data persistence library, activity/UI lifecycle methods, LiveData observable holder class, and etc.

WeatherDot utilizes OpenWeather's free [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for all of the data and weather icons shown inside of the app.

Here's what you'll find when using WeatherDot:

  * Easily view a city's current weather forecast or plan ahead with the 7 day forecast.

  * Features a simple and clean UI that doesn't get in the way of showing you essential weather data from thousands of cities.

  * Allows you to designate and save your favorite locations for quick access.

  * No ads, no trackers, and no data collection methods are featured, which presents a completely private and secure app environment.
